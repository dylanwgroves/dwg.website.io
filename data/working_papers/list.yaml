    How does cross-national empathy influence public attitudes towards international cooperation? Few studies have considered whether the capacity to see the world from the perspective of other actors promotes international cooperation or how partisanship may condition empathy's effects. In this paper, we argue that cross-national empathy increases support for international agreements because seeing issues through the eyes of other states makes potential gains from cooperation more salient. However, partisan attachments undercut this effect. Across two waves of an original survey experiment covering 4,788 respondents, we find that cues to “step into” the perspective of other states increase support international cooperation. But this effect is concentrated entirely among those with weak partisan attachments. Descriptive text analysis confirms these differential effects across subgroups, while the results hold regardless of the issue area and potential partner country.

    Early and forced marriage (EFM) is widespread through the developing world and an increasing focus of international organizations and local non-government organizations. The present study assesses the extent to which attitudes and norms related to EFM can be changed by locally tailored media campaigns. A condensed version of a locally sourced radio drama set in a rural Muslim Tanzanian community was presented to villagers in Tanzania as part of a placebo controlled experiment randomized at the village level. A random sample of 1,200 villagers was interviewed at baseline and invited to attend a presentation of the radio drama, and 83% attended. 95% of baseline respondents were reinterviewed two weeks later. The radio drama produced sizable and statistically significant effects on attitudes and perceived norms concerning EFM but not about gender equality more generally. Opinion change proved to be strongest in villages that at baseline displayed the most conservative views regarding EFM. Exploratory analysis of individual-level effect heterogeneity also suggests that effects tended to be highest among the most conservative. Muslim and Christian listeners were equally affected.

- title: "Who is Susceptible to Media Influence? Applying Machine Learning to a Multi-Message Experimental Design in Tanzania"
  coauthors: "Donald P Green, Beatrice Montano, and Bardia Rahmani"
  abstract: >
    A growing research literature shows that mass media can meaningfully influence politically relevant attitudes and behaviors, but little attention has been paid to treatment effect heterogeneity. Are some people more susceptible to media influence than others? Is susceptibility to influence message-specific, or are certain people highly susceptible to influence across messages? To assess whether susceptibility to influence manifests across messages, we implement a two-message experimental placebo design that exposes Tanzanian villagers to persuasive radio dramas about either forced marriage or HIV stigma. Finding substantial average effects on attitudes, political priorities, and voting preferences, we use machine learning to detect heterogeneous effects across messages as a function of respondents' background attributes. Our results indicate that the factors that predict treatment responsiveness are negatively correlated across these messages. These results suggest that susceptibility to influence is message-specific.
