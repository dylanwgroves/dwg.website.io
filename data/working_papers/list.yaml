    Early and forced marriage (EFM) is widespread through the developing world and an increasing focus of international organizations and local non-government organizations. The present study assesses the extent to which attitudes and norms related to EFM can be changed by locally tailored media campaigns. A condensed version of a locally sourced radio drama set in a rural Muslim Tanzanian community was presented to villagers in Tanzania as part of a placebo controlled experiment randomized at the village level. A random sample of 1,200 villagers was interviewed at baseline and invited to attend a presentation of the radio drama, and 83% attended. 95% of baseline respondents were reinterviewed two weeks later. The radio drama produced sizable and statistically significant effects on attitudes and perceived norms concerning EFM but not about gender equality more generally. Opinion change proved to be strongest in villages that at baseline displayed the most conservative views regarding EFM. Exploratory analysis of individual-level effect heterogeneity also suggests that effects tended to be highest among the most conservative. Muslim and Christian listeners were equally affected.

    A growing body of evidence investigates how mass media interventions to address HIV/AIDS influence knowledge, stigma, and openness to discussing HIV status. The present study shows that in addition to these effects, mass media interventions influence cognate policy preferences, including support for access to HIV/AIDS medical care. A condensed (2 hour) version of a popular Swahili radio drama was presented to rural Tanzanians as part of a placebo-controlled experiment randomized at the village level. A random sample comprising 1,200 participants were interviewed at baseline and invited to attend a presentation of the radio drama, and 83% attended. 95% of baseline respondents were re-interviewed two weeks later. In addition to increased knowledge and support for transparency, the radio drama produced sizable and statistically significant effects on prioritization of policies to increased access to HIV/AIDS treatments and on vote choice for hypothetical candidates promising improved HIV/AIDS treatment.
