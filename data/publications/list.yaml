    Classic theories suggest that common pool resources are subject to overexploitation. Community-based resource management approaches may ameliorate “tragedy of the commons” effects. Using a randomized evaluation in Namibia’s communal rangelands, we find that a comprehensive four-year program to support community-based rangeland and cattle management led to persistent and large improvements for eight of thirteen indices of social and behavioral outcomes. Effects on rangeland health, cattle productivity and household economics, however, were either negative or nil. Positive impacts on community resource management may have been offset by communities’ inability to control grazing by non-participating herds and inhibited by an unresponsive rangeland sub-system. This juxtaposition, in which measurable improvements in community resource management did not translate into better outcomes for households or rangeland health, demonstrates the fragility of the causal pathway from program implementation to intended socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. It also points to challenges for improving climate change–adaptation strategies.

    A growing body of evidence investigates how mass media interventions to address HIV/AIDS influence knowledge, stigma, and openness to discussing HIV status. The present study shows that in addition to these effects, mass media interventions influence cognate policy preferences, including support for access to HIV/AIDS medical care. A condensed (2 hour) version of a popular Swahili radio drama was presented to rural Tanzanians as part of a placebo-controlled experiment randomized at the village level. A random sample comprising 1,200 participants were interviewed at baseline and invited to attend a presentation of the radio drama, and 83% attended. 95% of baseline respondents were re-interviewed two weeks later. In addition to increased knowledge and support for transparency, the radio drama produced sizable and statistically significant effects on prioritization of policies to increased access to HIV/AIDS treatments and on vote choice for hypothetical candidates promising improved HIV/AIDS treatment.

    The standard approach to measuring livestock ownership in pastoralist communities relies on an assumption of uniformity that does not reflect the diverse concepts of ownership held by pastoralists themselves. In Namibia’s Koakaveld Region, Himba and Herero pastoralist communities have a rich vocabulary for categorising the origins, usage rights and cultural valence of their cattle. Drawing on both authors’ experience overseeing a large-scale rangeland management programme evaluation in Namibia’s Northern Communal Areas – and one author’s experience growing up in and keeping cattle in a Himba pastoralist community – we show how the standard approach to measuring cattle ownership undermines accurate estimates of livestock wealth, off-take and inequality, and obfuscates pastoralist’s strategies for turning ecological variability to their advantage. We conclude with lessons about how multi-dimensional data collection methods improve upon the standard approach to livestock ownership measurements.
